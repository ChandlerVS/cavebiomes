# Cave Biomes
Cave Biomes is a Minecraft Mod for Fabric that adds, well, cave biomes to your Minecraft world to make it more exciting to explore!

The biomes generate in two layers: in the first layer the cave biome mimics the overworld biome, and in the second layer, a unique and interesting
cave biome is generated.
